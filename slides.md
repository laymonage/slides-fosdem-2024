# Wagtail CMS

An open source content management system (CMS) built on Django.

The `Page` model acts as both "model" and "view". The tree structure of the model is reflected in your website's URL structure.

Wagtail gives you the power to:
- see a live preview as you edit
- save revisions
- manage live/draft versions
- moderate your content
- and much more!

      serve_preview()
      save_revision()
      ...()
      live
      locked

# Registering your models

Wagtail primarily works with its `Page` model. For other models, you can register them as "snippets".

Add a `@register_snippet` decorator to your model and specify the editable fields using `panels`.

```python
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.snippets.models import register_snippet

@register_snippet
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField()
    ...

    # Optional, but allows you to fine-tune the editable fields and their order
    panels = [
        FieldPanel("name"),
        FieldPanel("description"),
        ...
    ]
```

# Enabling live preview

<div v-click="[0, 1]">

The preview feature comes from the `PreviewableMixin` class.

To use it, add it as a superclass to your model. Then, override the `get_preview_template` and `get_preview_context` methods.

```python
from wagtail.models import PreviewableMixin


@register_snippet
class Product(PreviewableMixin, models.Model):
    ...

    def get_preview_template(self, request, preview_mode):
        return f"products/detail.html"

    def get_preview_context(self, request, preview_mode):
        return {"product": self}
```

</div>

<div v-after>

You can define different preview modes using the `preview_modes` attribute.

```python
...
class Product(PreviewableMixin, models.Model):
    ...

    preview_modes = [
        ("index", "Index"),
        ("detail", "Detail"),
    ]

    def get_preview_template(self, request, preview_mode):
        return f"products/{preview_mode}.html"

    def get_preview_context(self, request, preview_mode):
        if preview_mode == "index":
            return {"products": [self]*20}
        return {"product": self}
```

</div>

<style>
  .slidev-vclick-hidden {
    display: none;
  }
  .grid-cols-2 {
    grid-template-columns: 4fr 3fr !important;
  }
</style>

---
layout: default

# Enabling revisions

You can have revisions for your model by extending the `RevisionMixin` class.

```python
from wagtail.models import RevisionMixin

...
class Product(RevisionMixin, PreviewableMixin, models.Model):
    ...
```

Then, create and and run the migrations.

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

This allows you to **compare** the changes between revisions and **revert** to a previous revision.

transition: none

# Enabling "draft" changes

Wagtail allows you to save unpublished changes (**"drafts"**) of your models. This functionality is provided by the `DraftStateMixin`.

```python
from wagtail.models import DraftStateMixin

...
class Product(DraftStateMixin, RevisionMixin, PreviewableMixin, models.Model):
    ...
```

After creating and running the migrations, you can make use of the `live` field of the model.

```python
Product.objects.filter(live=True)
```

Unpublished changes are saved as `Revision`s and will not be reflected to your model's instance until you publish them.

<style>
  .grid-cols-2 {
    grid-template-columns: 4fr 3fr !important;
  }
  .grid-cols-2 :last-child {
    background-size: contain !important;
  }
</style>

hideInToc: true

# Enabling "draft" changes

To enable the scheduled publishing feature, add the `PublishingPanel` to your model's `panels`.

```python
from wagtail.admin.panels import PublishingPanel

...
class Product(DraftStateMixin, RevisionMixin, PreviewableMixin, models.Model):
    ...

    panels = [
        ...
        PublishingPanel(),
    ]
```

<style>
  .grid-cols-2 {
    grid-template-columns: 4fr 3fr !important;
  }
  .grid-cols-2 :last-child {
    background-size: contain !important;
  }
</style>

---
layout: image-right
image: ./images/locking.png
---

# Enabling locking

You can prevent multiple users from editing the same model instance at the same time by using the `LockableMixin` class.

```python
from wagtail.models import LockableMixin

...
class Product(
    DraftStateMixin,
    LockableMixin,
    RevisionMixin,
    PreviewableMixin,
    models.Model,
):
    ...
```

After making and running the migrations, Wagtail will give you the option to lock the model instance.

<style>
  .grid-cols-2 {
    grid-template-columns: 3fr 2fr !important;
  }
  .grid-cols-2 :last-child {
    background-size: contain !important;
  }
</style>

---
layout: image-right
image: ./images/workflow.png
transition: none
---

# Enabling workflows

Wagtail allows you to define workflows for your models, which can be used to moderate content changes before they go live. This functionality is provided by the `WorkflowMixin` class.

```python
from wagtail.models import WorkflowMixin

...
class Product(
    WorkflowMixin,
    DraftStateMixin,
    LockableMixin,
    RevisionMixin,
    PreviewableMixin,
    models.Model,
):
    ...
```

<style>
  .grid-cols-2 {
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr !important;
  }
  .grid-cols-2 :last-child {
    background-size: contain !important;
  }
</style>

---

# Enabling workflows

By default, Wagtail gives you the "Moderators approval" workflow, which requires a moderator to approve the changes before they go live.

You can create custom workflows with custom tasks to suit your specific needs.

<style>
  .grid-cols-2 {
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr !important;
  }
  .grid-cols-2 :last-child {
    background-size: contain !important;
  }
</style>
